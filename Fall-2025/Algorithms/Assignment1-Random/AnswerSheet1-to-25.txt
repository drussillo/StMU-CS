
 1. C: RandomDouble().

 2. time(NULL) returns the current Unix timestamp, which is an integer 
    representing the current date and time, measured in seconds since 
    the Unix epoch (Jan 1st, 1970, 12:00AM UTC).

 3. True.
 
 4. True, but the origin of the "randomness" is still rand().
 
 5. That is because of the way RandomInt() is handled. It relies on 
    multiplying n by a random double in the interval [0.0, 1.0), which
    means that RandomDouble() should return a value smaller than 1.0.
    If R == RAND_MAX is true, R / RAND_MAX will return 1.0. Therefore, 
    R cannot be the same value as RAND_MAX.

 6. RandomBool() returns true approximately 75% of the time, if bias=0.75.

 7. size should be 6.

 8. B: 2-out-of-6 times.

 9. D: A, B, and C

10. ..\ is a path to the directory in which the current directory is located.

11. Uniformly and randomly-chosen means that the result is chosen unpredictably 
    and without bias. All outcomes have the same likelyhood.

12. D: function prototypes

13. RandomBool(0.5) must return 0.

14. The backlashed are used as escape sequences here in order to inform
    the compiler to ignore the double quotes and to treat them as any other
    character within the string.

15. True.
