Problem #51 CCTQs
 1. pointer-to function AreEQ()

 2. Concerning data type signed long long int
    a. 8 bytes = 64 bits
    b. T because signed is the default when signed/unsigned are not specified
    c. %lld
    d. [ -2^63,2^63-1 ]

 3. the i-is-1 case is handled *outside* the loop as follows
      RunOneTrial(&count,n,AreEQ);
      minCount = count;
      maxCount = count;
      sumCount = count;
    note that the general case (handled by the for-statement body) is identified 
    with i in [ 2,T ].

 4. IYHO concerning dynamic allocation from the heap with malloc()

 5. concerning the statement *count = 0;
    a. * has higher precedence
    b. F because only = has a side-effect
    c. T because = and * have RL associativity
    d. * arity is 1, = arity is 2

 6. IYHO concerning which is "better", EQ(...) or (*EQ)(...)?

 7. when the resource leak occurs too often (for example, when it occurs in a loop),
       it is possible to run-out-of the resource

 8. F, but when the body contains more than 1 statement, the the {} are 
       *absolutely* required

 9. a uniformly-distributed random integer chosen from the closed interval [ 1,n ]

10. it is the i-th integer in xs[], xs[i], that is being investigated to see if it
       already exists in xs[1:i-1]
