*** Include ***

Include is a C preprocessor directive. It serves to incorporate
the contents of another file into the current one. Usually, it
is used to include header files from the C standard library or
user defined ones. Include is usually placed at the start of a
C file, before any of the other code. Included files can either
be in the same directory as the file that includes them or can
be added to the preprocessor using different flags depending
on the compiler. Common header files are 
stdio.h     // file and input/output functions and types
stdlib.h    // memory allocation, random
string.h    // see string function tutor
stdbool.h   // boolean type

The syntax of include is 
     #include <(C standard library file)>
     #include "(user defined file)"

*** Include Examples ***

     #include <stdio.h>
This instance of include serves to add all the functions located
in the standard library stdio.h file to the current source code.
It will allow the code to use functions such as printf, and types
such as FILE.

     #include "myheader.h"
In this instance, include takes all the contents from myheader.h,
which is completely user defined.

     #include "module1.h"
Here, include is used to incorporate all the contents from a user
defined module. This module can be part of a bigger project, where
code separation and modularity become essential. Include allows
developers to make their code as modular as they want.
